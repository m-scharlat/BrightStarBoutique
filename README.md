  ## Insights Summary - Sales by Product Category & Sub-Category

**In order to evaluate sales performance, I focused on the following key metrics:**

+ **Sales Volume:** The quantity of units sold.
+ **Revenue:** The amount of money made from the sale of products.
+ **Average Order Value (AOV):** The average amount of money spent per order.

NOTE: **The metrics are sliced across Product Category and Sub-Category**

### Product Category

**Sales Volume:**
+ The company has sold a total of 24,224 units in its lifetime (6.5 years)
+ The highest performing product category in terms of sales volume is accessories having sold in total 8,410 units. Whereas, beauty products have sold the least amount of units at 2,906.

**Revenue:**
+ In total, the company has made $1,115,895 in revenue in its lifetime (6.5 years)
+ Clothing has brought in the most revenue of all the categories with $491,635 and beauty products have brought in the least amount of revenue at $72,821

**Average Order Value (AOV):** 
+ The company wide AOV is $60.17
+ Clothing ($87.01) and footwear ($61.43) both sell at a higher AOV than the company average. While accessories ($39.73) and beauty products ($37.36) are well below the company AOV.
+ This effectively means that clothing and footwear are pulling more of the weight per order than the other two categories and together combine for 73.6% of total revenue while making up only 53% of units sold.
+ It's important to note that the reason for the lower AOV for accessories and beauty products is due to those categories being cheaper per item, nonetheless it is important to recognize that the "heavy-lifting" products are primarily in the categories of clothing and footwear.

### Product Sub-Category

**Sales Volume:**
+ Jewelry and dresses are the two highest selling product sub-categories in term of sales volume at 5,974 units and 3,230 units respectively.
+ The lowest selling sub-category is by far outerwear at 345 units followed by makeup (931), haircare (971 units), and sunglasses (982 units).

**Revenue:**
+ When looking at revenue numbers across sub-categories we can see that dresses ($279,308) and shoes ($243,428) bring in the most revenue.
+ Makeup and haircare generate the lowest amount of revenue at $18,611 and $29,120 respectively.

**Average Order Value (AOV):** 
+ In terms of sub-categories, AOV is where things getting interesting. Outerwear has the highest AOV at $185.47 followed by dresses at $112.04.
+ Combining the fact that outerwear has an AOV of $185.47 and has only sold 345 units (1.4% of units sold) tells us that outerwear is an untapped opportunity for revenue growth.
+ Conversely, looking at poor performing categories in terms of AOV help paint a picture of which product sub-categories deserve less attention from the company. These include jewelry ($28.13), makeup ($29.59), sunglasses ($37.3), skincare ($37.5), and sandals ($38.93).

### Key Takeaways
+ Clothing and footwear product categories are the biggest money makers in terms of revenue and AOV for BrightStar with beauty products lagging behind.
+ The main drivers for clothing and footwear are the product sub-categories dresses and shoes which are top products in terms of quantity, revenue, and AOV. Together they combine to make up 26% of units sold and 46% of total revenue both with AOVs more than 2x the company wide average.
+ Outerwear is an untapped opportunity for BrightStar having sold the lowest number of units of any product category while possesing the highest AOV. This makes outerwear a prime target for marketing/promotional focus of Brightstar.
